## 1. Add sop - can add point, can move it with transform in viewport
## 2. Point jitter (quick noise on curves, trails etc)
## 3. Measure 
- can measure geometry curvature
## 4. Attrb promote
- to find min and max attrb value (e.g. curvature) through all the points
- name of the attrib (curvature)
- promote from point to detail
- promotion method max or min
- change original name to curve_max for example
- don't have to delete original
## 5. Trail sop
- compute velocity
  - Velocity Approximation - Central difference - so you get some vel on first and last frame
