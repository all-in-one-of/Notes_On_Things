## 1. Basics
- objects is grey plug
- data is green plug
## 2. Units
- real world
- edit/preferences/hip file options m and kg
## 3. Physical parms
- rotational stifness - how much object will spin (how much object inherites rotation when hit by another object), 0 - means no rotation
- bounce - how much energy conservation there is when two objects collide, this is multiplication between the two objects (e.g. sphere and the ground)
- friction - how difficult is to move object from rest. 0 - no resistance at all
- dynamic friction - multiplier for objects that are already moving
