## 1. What works
- channel to released gas (divergence)
- channel to inherited vel from source (just spherical)


## 2. Want to try
- fluid source particles - works
- control velocity out and up with different channels - works

- emit more particles (final particles) with channel - need to add more particles or more divergence/fuel
- snare is too sharp/too short - needs to be smoothed out, I already made it stronger
