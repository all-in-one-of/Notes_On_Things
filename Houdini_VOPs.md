## 2. Noisses
- aa flow noise - range from -0.25 to 0.25
- 1D noise for color means it will output float do gray color only, 3D noise will be colorfull
- 4D input
  - before connecting noise you can choose it to have 4D inmput - this is when you wand position and time as input (for aaflow noise for example)
  - use vector to vector 4 to combine pos and time into one vector
