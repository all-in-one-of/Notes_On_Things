- there are cool patterns, not just noises. Search for pattern
## 2. Noisses
- aa flow noise - range from -0.25 to 0.25
- 1D noise for color means it will output float do gray color only, 3D noise will be colorfull
- 4D input
  - before connecting noise you can choose it to have 4D inmput - this is when you wand position and time as input (for aaflow noise for example)
  - use vector to vector 4 to combine pos and time into one vector
## 3. Parameter VOP
- create new attributes
## 4. Bind Export
- export attributes
## 5. Compliment
- makes 1-the thing (for example normalized age to feed to pscale if you want particles to get smaller with age)
## 6. Clamp
## 7. Random
- gives rand number from 0 - 1, can based on id for particles or ptnum for meshes
## 8. Power
- use if you want to change distribution (in size for example). Many small particles and only few big ones
## 9. Add const
## 10. Alpha
